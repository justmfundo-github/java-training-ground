CLEAR AND REFRESH
Clear:      performs an entity wide detach. I.e all managed entities are detached in one fell swoop
Refresh:    goes back to the database to retrieve a clean copy of an entity. I.e if you had started to dirty/update
            the entity and now desire the original entity from the database, you can use the refresh method.
